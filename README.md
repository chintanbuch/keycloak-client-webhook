# Keycloak Webhook Extension

A Keycloak extension that sends webhook notifications to external APIs when specific user events occur in Keycloak.

## Overview

This extension integrates with Keycloak's event system to capture user-related events such as registration, login, logout, and password resets. When these events occur, the extension sends HTTP POST requests with user data to a configured webhook endpoint.

Key features:
- Listens for REGISTER, LOGIN, LOGOUT, RESET_PASSWORD, VERIFY_EMAIL, and UPDATE_EMAIL events
- Sends structured JSON payloads with comprehensive user information
- Supports authentication with API keys
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Configurable through Keycloak client attributes

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Keycloak 26.2.2 or compatible version
- Maven for building the project

## Installation

1. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. Copy the generated JAR file to Keycloak's providers directory:
   ```bash
   cp target/keycloak-client-webhook.jar /path/to/keycloak/providers/
   ```

3. Restart Keycloak to load the extension.

## Configuration

### 1. Enable the Event Listener

1. Log in to the Keycloak Admin Console
2. Navigate to your realm
3. Go to Realm Settings â†’ Events
4. In the "Event Listeners" field, add `brew-event-webhook`
5. Click "Save"

### 2. Configure Webhook Endpoint

The webhook URL and API key are configured at the client level. For each client that should trigger webhooks:

1. Navigate to Clients in the Keycloak Admin Console
2. Select the client you want to configure
3. Go to the Attributes tab
4. Add the following attributes:
   - `api.url`: The URL of your webhook endpoint (e.g., `https://your-api.example.com/webhooks/keycloak`)
   - `api.key`: The API key or token for authenticating with your webhook endpoint

## Webhook Payload

The extension sends a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "LOGIN",
  "user_id": "f:6f8df73e-9c42-4f8b-b3a1-c1d9bcb45f0b",
  "user_name": "john.doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email_verified": true,
  "created_timestamp": 1621459200000,
  "user_ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ..."
}
```

## Supported Events

The extension currently listens for the following Keycloak events:
- `REGISTER`: When a new user registers
- `LOGIN`: When a user logs in
- `LOGOUT`: When a user logs out
- `RESET_PASSWORD`: When a user resets their password
- `VERIFY_EMAIL`: When a user verifies their email address
- `UPDATE_EMAIL`: When a user's email address is updated

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Triggering

1. Verify the event listener is properly enabled in the realm settings
2. Check that the client has the correct `api.url` and `api.key` attributes
3. Examine Keycloak server logs for any error messages
4. Ensure your webhook endpoint is accessible from the Keycloak server

### HTTP Connection Issues

The extension implements retry logic with exponential backoff. If there are temporary connection issues, it will retry up to 3 times with increasing delays. Since webhook calls are executed asynchronously, these retries happen in the background and don't affect Keycloak's performance or user experience.
